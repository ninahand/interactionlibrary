        <p><span> When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-one-two">
    <p>There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of </p>

<div class="column-two">
    <div class="column-two-one">
         <p>every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-two-two">
        <p><span>Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-two-three">
      <p>These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.</p>  
    </div>
    <div class="column-two-bottom">
        <div class="column-two-four">
            <p>At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-two-five">
            <p>basic mysteries-the origin of the Library and of time - might be found.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="column-three">
    <div class="column-three-one">
        <p>It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-three-two">
        <p>For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons... There are official searchers, inquisitors.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="column-four">
    <div class="column-four-one">
        <p> I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-four-two">
        <p><span>Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-four-three">
        <p><span>As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-four-five">
        <p>A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance,</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="column-five">
    <div class="column-five-one">
        <p>these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-five-two">
        <p>The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-five-three">
        <p>Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the "treasures" destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-five-four">
        <p><span> One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-five-five">
        <p> Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.</p>
